To obtain thread dumps from a JBoss (WildFly) application server, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the JBoss Process:
   - Find the process ID (PID) of the JBoss server. You can do this by using commands like `ps` on Linux or using Task Manager on Windows.

   ps -ef | grep java
 

2. Use jstack to Get Thread Dump:
   - Once you have the PID, use `jstack` to capture the thread dump. Run the following command in your terminal:

   jstack <PID> > thread_dump.txt

   Replace `<PID>` with the actual process ID. This command will save the thread dump to a file named `thread_dump.txt`.


### Notes

- Access Permissions: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to execute these commands, especially in production environments.
- Performance Impact: Taking thread dumps may have a temporary impact on performance, so consider doing this during a maintenance window or when the system is under low load.

By following these methods, you should be able to successfully capture thread dumps from your JBoss application server.
